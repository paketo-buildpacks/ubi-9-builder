# Paketo Ubi 8 Buildpackless Base Builder

## `paketobuildpacks/builder-ubi8-buildpackless-base`

This builder uses the [UBI 8 Base Stack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/ubi8-base-stack) (a Red Hat Ubi 8 base image) and contains **no buildpacks nor order groups**.
To use this builder, you must specify buildpacks and extensions at build time using whatever mechanisms your CNB platform of choice offers.

For example, with the `pack` CLI, use `--buildpack` or/and `--extension` as follows:

```
pack build nodejs-with-buildpackless-builder \
           --path ./app-dir \
           --buildpack paketobuildpacks/nodejs \
           --extension paketobuildpacks/ubi-nodejs-extension \
           --builder paketobuildpacks/builder-ubi8-buildpackless-base
```

To see which versions of build and run images and the lifecycle are contained within a given builder version, see the [Releases](https://github.com/paketo-community/builder-ubi8-buildpackless-base/releases) on this repo. This information is also available in the `builder.toml`.
